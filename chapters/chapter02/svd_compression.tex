- Derive usage of SVD appx in the context of PyExaFMM

- derivation from trefethan on how this offers an optimal appx

- brief comment on state of the art, randomised compression, methods.

- brief comment on lack of implementations in this field for FMMs

- comment on how most of the 'energy' of an operator can be captured by
considering dominant singular values.

- practical implementation computed in serial,
    - multiprocessing can be applied in future

- indicate where the experiments will be done on this.
