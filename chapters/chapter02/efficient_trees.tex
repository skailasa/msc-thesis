Spatial decompositions of a set of $d$ dimensional coordinates into a single
dimension is widely applied across computational science. The spatial
decompositions of $d$ dimensional cubes especially finds a wide variety of applications,
from forming the basis of implementations of finite-element methods, to algorithms
for mesh refinement, and importantly in our case, $N$-body simulations
\cite{Sundar:2008:SIAM}. Spatial decompositions utilise space-filling curves,
these infinite-curves are fractal, and by increasing their `order' can be made
to `fill', or describe, a $d$ dimensional space uniquely, simply by their position
along the length of the curve \cite{Campbell:2003:Williams}. This concept is
illustrated in figure (\ref{fig:2_2_multi_order}) for the Morton encoding, or a
`Z-order' encoding, a variant of space-filling curves used in \gls{PyExaFMM}
that better preserves the proximality of data in the encoded coordinates than
 most other encodings, in addition to being easier to implement as it doesn't
 have the requirement that the encoded line has to be continuous.
 Figure (\ref{fig:2_2_multi_order}) illustrates the fractal nature of a Morton
 encoded line at two adjacent levels of a quadtree in two dimensions. The
 position along the line in each quadrant of a given box can be efficiently represented as a pair of `binary coordinates'
 corresponding to the index of the quadrant the line passes through for a given box.
 For example, the bottom-left quadrant at the coarser level in figure (\ref{fig:2_2_multi_order})
 will have a binary coordinate of $00$. This encoding can be made unique for each
 quadrant in each level by adding a displacement corresponding to the number of boxes so far
 encoded at all coarser levels. For example, the first encoded box, which in figure (\ref{fig:2_2_multi_order})
 corresponds to the binary coordinate $00$ will have a displacement due to the
 number of boxes thus far encoded at this level, and all coarser levels, of which
 there are none in this case, of 0. This leaves this first box with a Morton encoded position,
 or \textbf{\gls{key}} of 0 in base ten. Similarly, the encoding for the bottom-left box at the finer
 level in figure (\ref{fig:2_2_multi_order}) will have binary coordinates of $00$,
 and a displacement due to the number of boxes encoded at previous levels of 4
 \footnote{As is common in computer science, we begin indexing at 0, rather than 1.},
therefore it's Morton \gls{key} in base ten will be $4$.

This concept is easily extended to three dimensions, and is illustrated in
figure (\ref{fig:2_2_morton_encoding}) at level 1 of an octree. Here the binary
coordinates simply contain three bits, for the $xyz$ octant of a given cube
in the octree, and the displacement mechanism is entirely analogous with the
two dimensional case.

The binary coordinates of Morton encoded octants make it easy to perform simple
bitwise shift and comparison operations, to assign source and \gls{target-particles} the Morton key
that encodes the octant they lie in for each level of a given octree, as well as traverse the levels of
the octree. Specifically, \gls{PyExaFMM} makes use of a \textit{linear} Morton encoding, meaning that it assigns
all particles to the keys of boxes they occupy at a which has been refined to a
pre-defined leaf level of the desired octree. It does so by assuming that the
leaf level of the octree describing the domain of interest is partitioned into equal
sized leaf boxes, and checking the relative coordinates position of each particle
with respect to the expected indices of the leaf boxes. Furthermore, this operation only provides
a set of keys at the leaf-level which are non-empty, allowing \gls{PyExaFMM} to
ignore the remainder of the space covered by the domain of the octree. Once this
linear representation has been found, and the non-empty boxes containing
source and \gls{target-particles} identified, it's easy to traverse the octree
to find the ancestor boxes which particles lie in by simply subtracting the appropriate
offset due to the box's position on the encoded line, and adding a new offset at
at level of the ancestor box. The inverse operation can be done to provide the set
of keys corresponding to the descendent boxes for a given box. In terms of the
\gls{FMM} and \gls{KIFMM} algorithms, the above operations can be extended trivially
in simple combination to pre-compute \gls{interaction-list}s for each box, containing
only source boxes which aren't empty, as well as to find \gls{near-neighbours} of
a given box at a given level of the octree.

The power of encoding the domain of the octree lie in the optimisation opportunities
that arise. \gls{PyExaFMM} works entirely in terms of encoded Morton keys, using
them to lookup the correct operators, and store computational results against.
This makes it possible to use Numba's \gls{JIT} functionality to precompile the bitwise
operations, which are used heavily in \gls{PyExaFMM}'s implementation of the \gls{KIFMM}
main loop, mainly to assign computed multipole/local coefficients. This implementation
detail represents the first step towards optimising tree construction, with the
field of optimising highly-parallel tree constructions for octrees potentially containing
$10^9$ or more octree boxes, being an active field of research \cite{Sundar:2008:SIAM,Malhotra:2015:CCP}.
For example, the authors of PVFMM, one of the major C++ \gls{KIFMM} implementations,
evenly distribute the load of encoding particles for particularly deep trees across
multiple processes using \gls{MPI} \cite{Malhotra:2015:CCP}. For highly non-uniform
data distributions the non-adaptive implementation of \gls{PyExaFMM} currently
will wastefully refine regions of the octree with a low density of particles, major
open source \gls{KIFMM} implementations thus implement adaptive tree refinement,
with different sized leaf boxes in different regions of the domain decsribed by
the octree \cite{Ying:2004:JCP, Malhotra:2015:CCP, exafmm}.
