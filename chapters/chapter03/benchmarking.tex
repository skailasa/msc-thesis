- numba benchmark code
    - comment on the programmer efficiency in simply decorating with Numba

- Estimate cost savings from each parallelization step
- Multiproc
- SVD compression
- numba
- hdf5 vs pickle

- Compare experimental results for FMM vs Direct computation as a function of number of particles for the LAPLACE KERNEL!!!!. Justify usage of laplace kernel (paradigm, easy etc.)

- [DIAGRAM] Need to plot the computational complexity.

- Understand cost of computation via pyexafmm compared to state of the art exafmm-t.
    - Comment on where the slowness comes from
        - no parallelism for operator evaluations
        - no parallelism for memory sharing
            - lots of copying of same data.
        - subtoptimal data formats for m2l - lots of loading.
        - suboptimal size of data structures lead to loading from non-cpu memory - which is slow - could be optimized via numexpr etc in the future or more intricate chunking of memory.
    - These are justifiable from the time constraints on full-time development.
