Using a low-rank \gls{SVD} approximation for the \gls{M2L} operator matrix
naturally leads to the question of what the optimum choice for target rank for $k$
is (see Chapter \ref{chpt:2_strategy_for_practical_implementation}, Section \ref{sec:2_4_svd_compression}).
Naturally, we want to minimise $k$ to reduce the asymptotic complexity of
the application of the compressed \gls{M2L} operator. However, it's clear that
if $k$ is taken to be too low, we will be losing potentially important data
from the original uncompressed \gls{M2L} matrix. However, if $k$ is too high
we will be keeping redundant singular vectors which do not contribute significantly
to the final result for potential.

For this experiment we use a 3 level octree containing 1000 randomly distributed
particles in a unit cube, which are taken to be sources as well as targets, and
have source charge densities of 1 C, we compute $p=3$ degree multipole and
local expansions therefore discretising each surface with 26 quadrature points.
We compute the mean percentage error of the \gls{PyExaFMM} result and
full-rank \gls{M2L} matrices, with respect to the direct result.
The mean is taken across all particles. For the above
tree topology and expansion order $p$, we find a a mean percentage error of
$1.96$ \% (2 d.p). This experiment is repeated for different low-rank approximations,
the results of which are illustrated in figure (\ref{fig:3_2_svd}).

Figure (\ref{fig:3_2_svd}) indicates that singular vectors corresponding to small
singular values are actually adding noise to the results of \gls{PyExaFMM}, with
an optimum target rank $k$ in the range 4-6 for the above tree topology.
