This thesis has been the product of two very long and concurrently short years
at UCL, returning to education whilst extricating myself from industry presented a type of
challenge that I wasn't entirely expecting. I'd like to thank my Mum for keeping
me on the right path, and without whose support this thesis would probably never
have happened. Furthermore, I'd like to thank my supervisor Timo Betcke, whose door
was always open, I couldn't really have asked for a much better thesis supervisor.
