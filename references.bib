abstract = {We present an adaptive fast multipole method for solving the Poisson equation in two dimensions. The algorithm is direct, assumes that the source distribution is discretized using an adaptive quad-tree, and allows for Dirichlet, Neumann, periodic, and free-space conditions to be imposed on the boundary of a square. The amount of work per grid point is comparable to that of classical fast solvers, even for highly nonuniform grids.},

It is based on a domain decomposition approach using local spectral approximation, as well as potential theory and the fast multipole method. In two space dimensions, the algorithm requires O(NK) work, where N is the number of discretization points and K is the desired order of accuracy.",
