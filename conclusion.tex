\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chpt:conclusion}

- Contributions
    - The first iteration of the 3D (somewhat) parallel KIFMM lib in a popular interpreted language.
    - well tested and extensibly designed software.

- Limitations
    - hardware for benchmarking larger data sets.
    - level of parallelism for speed.

- Future
    - multiple levels of parallelism (data/process/cpu etc) available, they should be explored and optimised.
    - implementation of new kernels.
    - implementation of gradients for benchmarking with open source standards
    - reduction in boiler plate code for data loading etc, in terms of design.
    - more integration tests due to complexity.
    - Parallel tree construction
    - An adaptive algorithm
    - Offloading M2L computation to specialized hardware
    - More robust SVD compression, randomized compression.
    - Multiproc svd compression library
    - Taking more check points than multipole/local points for more robust pseudo-inverse.
